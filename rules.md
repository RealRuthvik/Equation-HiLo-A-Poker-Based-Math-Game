# **Equation Hi-Lo: Game Rules**

Welcome to Equation Hi-Lo, a game of strategy, betting, and quick math copied from Netflix’s The Devil’s Plan, Season 1 \- Episode 11\. Players must build mathematical equations to hit specific target numbers while managing bets against opponents.

## **Objective**

The goal is to create an equation using your cards that results in a number closest to **1** (Lo) or **20** (Hi).

## **Components & Deck Setup**

The game uses a custom deck of **52 cards** and individual player symbol sets.

### **The Deck (52 Cards)**

* **44 Number Cards:** Values 0 through 10 (4 cards of each number).  
* **4 Root Cards (√)**  
* **4 Multiplication Cards (×)**

### **Card Tiers (Tie-Breakers)**

Every number card has a specific tier, which is used to break ties if players end up with the same result.

1. **Gold** (Highest)  
2. **Silver**  
3. **Bronze**  
4. **Dirt** (Lowest)

### **Player Hand**

* At the start of the game, every player receives a personal set of basic symbol cards: **\+**, **\-** & **/**.

## **Setup & Initial Deal**

1. **Forced Bet (Ante):** Before cards are dealt, every player must pay a forced bet of **1 chip**.  
2. **The Hidden Card:**  
   * The dealer deals **one face-down card** to each player.  
   * **Constraint:** This card *must* be a Number Card. If a Root or Multiplication card is dealt face-down, it is discarded/shuffled back, and a new card is dealt until a Number Card appears.  
3. **The Public Cards (Round 1):**  
   * Once everyone has their hidden card, the dealer deals **two face-up (public) cards** to each player.

## **Special Card Rules**

If special symbol cards appear during *any* public deal (Round 1 or Round 2), they trigger specific effects:

### **The Root Card (√)**

If a player receives a Root card as a face-up card:

* The player keeps the Root card.  
* The player is immediately dealt **one additional Number Card**.

### **The Multiplication Card (×)**

If a player receives a Multiplication card as a face-up card:

* The player **must discard** one of their held symbol cards (+, \-, or ×).  
  * *Note: The Division (/) symbol cannot be discarded.*  
* After discarding, the player receives **one additional Number Card**.

### **Chain Reaction Rule**

* If the "additional card" dealt (due to a Root or Mult effect) is *another* symbol card (Root or Mult), that symbol card is removed from play.  
* The dealer continues dealing until a **Number Card** is provided.

## **First Betting Round**

Once all players have their Hidden Card and their first two Public Cards (plus any extras from special rules), the first betting round begins.

* **Betting Options:** Call, Raise, or Fold.  
* **Starting:** The first player may Check (pass). However, once a bet is made, subsequent players cannot pass; they must Call, Raise, or Fold.  
* **Betting Limit:** The maximum bet cannot exceed the total chip count of the player with the lowest stack at the table.  
* **Ending the Round:** Betting continues until all active players have matched the highest bet.

## **Second Deal & Final Betting**

After the first betting round concludes, the game proceeds to the final stage for the remaining players.

1. **The Fourth Card (Round 2 Deal):**  
   * The dealer deals **one additional face-up card** to each remaining player.  
   * **Special Rules Apply:** If this card is a Root or Multiplication card, the corresponding effects trigger exactly as before (granting extra number cards or forcing symbol discards).  
2. **Formulating Equations:**  
   * Players assess their full hand (1 Hidden, 3+ Public, Symbol Cards) to determine their best possible equation.  
3. **Final Betting Round:**  
   * A final round of betting takes place with the same rules as the first.  
   * Players bet based on the strength of their final equation.

## **Showdown & Scoring**

After the final betting concludes, remaining players reveal their Hidden Card.

1. **Constructing Equations:**  
   * Players arrange their **Hidden Card**, **Public Cards**, and **Symbol Cards** to form their declared equation.  
   * The result must be a whole number (integers).  
2. **Hi vs. Lo:**  
   * Players declare whether they are competing for **Hi** (Target: 20\) or **Lo** (Target: 1).  
   * *Variation:* Depending on house rules, the game may split the pot between the best Hi and the best Lo, or players may have to lock in their choice before the reveal.  
3. **Winning:**  
   * The player closest to **1** wins the Lo hand.  
   * The player closest to **20** wins the Hi hand.

### **Tie-Breaker Rule**

If two players reach the exact same result (or are equidistant from the target):
* Compare the **Tiers** of the Number Cards used in their equations.  
* **Gold \> Silver \> Bronze \> Dirt**.  
* The player holding the highest-tier card involved in the equation wins the tie.
